### `Intro`

>React is a `library` for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components that present data that changes over time. It is not a complete application framework like angular, it is just a view layer. So it is not directly comparable to frameworks like angular.

### `Why should I use react JS?`
>It is used to handle all views of an application for any web or mobile application. ReactJS is also used to `reuse UI` components. React enables developers to create web applications that can change your data `without reloading` your page. The main advantage of React JS is that it is `scalable`, `simple` and `fast`.

### `First we assume that you already have a react project`
this for that already have react project if false
please try to install **`NodeJS`** or you can install **NPM** (node package manager)
and through it install **`create-react-app`** and after the installation you can create your project as:-
~~~~
$create-react-app my-app   or use npx   
$npx create-react-app my-app  
~~~~
=> please search **NPM, NPX and NVM (Node Version Manager)**

### `prerequisite`
* OS assumed it **Linux**  
* Editor (For Helping) assumed it **code visual studio** (it very good) and a favorite for most developers. Please Try It.
* Browser (to test your result) you can use whatever you want.

### `Launch Point`
go to project folder and open terminal and type the following command (i assume you work on `**Linux OS **` for example ubuntu)
~~~~
 $ sudo npm start  
~~~~
the mentioned command will start to react project to ready for work.

### `React Tutorial`
this is applying for the react library step by step and this tutorial as a future reference or ready code
and for fast reviewing about the react library.

### `React Projects`
In end of react lessons(basics) there group of very small **projects** to train about it to develope out of the box things

### `tutorial Lectures`
this tutorial is a component of more lessons from the beginning and has advanced lessons that can be a ready code for
future use.
and each group of lessons embedded in version so that you can study version by version and maybe made each version as a start point.

### `How To Work With This Tutorial`
there **`index.html`** page that has all react scripts one by one you can uncomment each script alone and Try It.  
For Note:-  
        => each script therein alone page for the test it alone and easy to study.
